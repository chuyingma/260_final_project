##BST 260 Final Project
##Group: Chuying Ma, Jingjing Tang, Jie Yin, Xuewei Zhang

This Rmd file is for conducting linear regression for menthlth and other covariates.

Due to the fact that there were less missing data in the outcome 'menthlth', we focused on the condition of mental health in the following multivariate analysis and classification section.

Actually this part is not shown on our website for our final analysis, but for us it is a nice try to study the relationship between pm 2.5, greenness and mental health

##Part 1.

Look for regression with pm 2.5, using backward selection and choose p = 0.05 as criteria via backward selection:
```{r}
data_all = read_csv("data_3_expo.csv")
reg_data = data_all %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(fips,state,state,year))
```

##conclusion

Taking mental health as example, multiple regression was applied to address the impact of environmental exposures adjusting for other socioeconomic factors, which shows a significant relationship between mental health and other environmental exposures and socioeconomic variables
